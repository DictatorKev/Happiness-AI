                                                                                Step by step:
                                                                                
   



1. looking for all words that would make a person happy. Walking, loving, kissing, thinking, favorite color...
2. try to give EVERY single word a number from 1 to 10000 specified whether it makes the average human happy and rank it up to 10000
3. have a variable which is "human" with the capability of having unlimited happiness power (starting by 0)
4. think about the things in life that can decrease the points and outcomes of single actions as an example (you said something bad about the bot, this results of decreasing all happiness actions by 0.3% and increase it once you apologize or just increase it up but 90% of the lost value).
5. think about new action coming up once hitting a specific point
